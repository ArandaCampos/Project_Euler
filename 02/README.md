<h1>Problem 2</h1>
<p>Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with <strong>1</strong> and <strong>2</strong>, the first <strong>10</strong> terms will be:</br>
<strong>1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...</strong></br>
<p>By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.</p>
