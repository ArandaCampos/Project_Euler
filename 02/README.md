<p>Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with $ and $, the first 0$ terms will be:
39811, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, \dots3981</p>
<p>By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.</p>
