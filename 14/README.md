<h1>Longest Collatz Sequence</h1>
<h2>Problem 14</h2>
<p>The following iterative sequence is defined for the set of positive integers:</p>
<li><i>n</i> = <i>n</i>/2 (n is even)</li>
<li><i>n</i> = 3<i>n</i> + 1 (n is odd)</li></ul>
<p>Using the rule above and starting with <i>13</i>, we generate the following sequence:
<strong>13 -> 40 -> 20 -> 10 -> 5 -> 16 -> 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1.</strong></p>
<p>It can be seen that this sequence (starting at <i>13</i> and finishing at <i>1</i>) contains <i>10</i> terms. Although it has not been proved yet (Collatz Problem), it is thought that all starting numbers finish at <i>1</i>.</p>
<p><strong>Which starting number, under one million, produces the longest chain?</strong></p>
<p><b>NOTE:</b> Once the chain starts the terms are allowed to go above one million.</p>
